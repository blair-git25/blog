**_1. Write a paragraph describing how you can use Intrusion Detection Systems to protect your network.  Include the differences between host based and network based systems._**

**_2. Write a brief paragraph on how can you use access controls and auditing to protect your  computer systems._**

#### 1. NIDS & HIDS

 To protect your network you can use a network based intrusion detection system (NIDS). A network based IDS is tailor made to work on the network layer and sits in between the internet and your end device. It works by analysing incoming and outgoing network traffic packets, inspecting them in real-time for malicious patterns or suspicious activity. When a potential threat is identified, it generates an alert.

 In comparison, a host based IDS (HIDS) typically installs an agent on your host device, such as a server or workstation. It monitors the host's internal state, analysing system logs, file integrity and running processes to detect unauthorised access or malicious behaviour. A host based IDS won't be as effective at protecting your network as a network based IDS.

#### 2. Access Control & Auditing

You can protect your computer system data by using a combination of access control and auditing. Access control limits what data a user can view or change. It can apply to local data via NTFS permissions or over network shares with Share permissions. This ensures only those with authorised access can view or modify specific data.

Auditing complements access control by creating a detailed record of system activity. It allows computer administrators or security teams to see who accessed, viewed or modified certain files. This can aid with identifying and preventing security breaches on your system by providing evidence and helping to recognise malicious behaviours & patterns.
