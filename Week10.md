#### Biometric Authentication Methods


| Biometric Authentication Method | Advantages | Disadvantages
|:----|----|----|
| Fingerprint Recognition | Fast and relatively inexpensive capture technology. Harder to fake than cards. You cannot forget or misplace them | Dirty or damaged fingers can cause failures. Can be fooled using gelatin copies. Sensors can become a hygiene risk as frequently touched.
|Iris Recognition | Very accurate modality with high discrimination between individuals. Patterns remain stable over a lifetime and infrared works regardless of eye colour. Contactless, so hygienic. | Requires expensive specialist equipment. Hard to capture a small target, can be obscured by eyelashes or contact lenses. Some users fear the technology and find it intrusive |
| Facial Recognition | Contactless, so hygienic. Can identify users from a distance. No specialist equipment required, standard cameras often suffice. | Accuracy depends on surrounding light, pose and expression. Vulnerable to presentation attaacks using photos/masks. |
| Vein Recognition | Hard to forge or spoof as veins are internal. Long lasting as vein patterns do not change from birth | Readers are expensive due to the capture technology. Generally less accurate than iris or fingerprint recognition |
| Hand Geometry | Works well in harsh environments where fingerprints may be dirty. Low cost and easy to setup. | Scanners are physically very large, so need a lot of space. Not unique enough for 1-to-many identification, only suitable for verifying a known user. |
| Retinal Scanning | Very efficient and almost impossible to spoof | High failure to enrol ratio. Scanner needs to be close to users eye which raises acceptability/hygiene concerns. |
| Voice Recognition | Generally perceived as user-friendly | Highly sensitive to background noise and acoustic quality. Enrolment can be time-consuming. |
