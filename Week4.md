#### Firewalls

A software Firewall  is a program installed on a personal PC that monitors and controls incoming/outgoing network traffic.  

A commonly used software Firewall is Windows Defender Firewall. This Firewall helps safeguard the Windows PC by filtering network traffic and blocking unauthorized access. It reduces the risk of network security threats by restricting or allowing traffic based on various properties such as IP addresses, ports, or program paths. 

 

##### Windows Firewall features 

- Traffic Filtering - inspects all traffic and allows/blocks based on predefined rules 

- Inbound/Outbound rules - can create rules for specific inbound or outbound connections 

- Application control - can block or allow network communication for specific applications and services 

- Profile-Based settings: Can configure different firewall settings for various network types (Private (home), Domain (work) and Public (college)) 

- Port and Protocol filtering - rules can be set to allow or block access based on specific port numbers and network protocols. 

- Stateful inspection - keeps track of active network connections, allowing it to make informed decisions about which packets to filter
