# Week 1 Write-up

This week I repurposed an old laptop by installing Ubuntu and VMWare Workstation. This will be my main coding/work machine.

- Installed Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS as the main OS on a i7-10510U, 16GB RAM, 250GB NVME SSD, HP Elitebook G7 830 Laptop
- Installed VMWare Workstation Pro
- Created a Kali Linux VM
- Created a Windows 10 Pro VM using the Azure ISO
- Checked CPU and RAM usage with i7z, lscpu, top and 'free -h'
- Installed Packet Tracer
- Installed WireShark
- Installed Visual Studio Code - including git/python extension
- Installed Edge and connected ot my college account
- Installed net-tools


  ## Issues :
    - Had to manually update and configure the GCC from v11 to v12 to get VMWare to run
