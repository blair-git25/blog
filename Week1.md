## Learning Outcome 1

**_Write a short paragraph explaining what you understand by the term ‘data breach’. You should list some of the consequences of a data breach for both the company and the client. (250 words)._**

#### Data breach 

A data breach happens when confidential, or sensitive information is accessed, stolen or exposed without permission. Once this happens the data can no longer be considered secure and is compromised.  

A **security breach** is broader and happens when there is unauthorized access to a secured system, site, application or network. A security breach may lead to a data breach, but it may also involve no loss or exposed data - data may still be secure during a security breach.  

A **security incident** is a general event that threatens or may threaten the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data and systems. This could be a suspicious login or a denial of service attack. Not every security incident becomes a security breach, but every breach starts of as an incident. 


#### Consequences of a data breach 

A **client** affected by a data breach may have personal details exposed like passwords, emails and bank details. This can lead to money being stolen, extortion or accounts being hacked. 

A **company** affected by a data breach can have business records or employee data exposed. Business deals and customers can also be affected, which could lead to business losses and job cuts. 

Companies have an **obligation** to report all personal data breaches under the UK GDPR law. They must notify the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) in the UK, within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach, and also notify any individuals severely affected by it. Failure to notify the ICO can lead to a heavy fine of up to £8.7 million or 2 per cent of the companies global turnover.
