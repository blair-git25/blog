## Learning Outcome 3

**_1. Explain ways of mitigating damage after a data breach.  Include a reference to complying with current legislation._**

**_2. Explain  briefly what is meant by the terms ‘whitelist’ and ‘blacklist’ and when corporate firewalls should employ these._**

#### 1. Mitigating/Complying

Ways to mitigate damage after a data breach involve:

- Containing the breach - Identify where the data breach happened, e.g. computer system or network, and take action to prevent further damage. This often involves disconnecting the affected systems from the internet.

- Access the risks: Identify what data was taken or exposed and if it was sensitive. Find out how many people where involved and also if the data was encrypted or not.

After containing and accessing the risks the breach victim must now comply with legislation under the UK GDPR. They must report the breach within 72 hours and notify affected data subjects if the breach risked their rights or freedoms (recommending password/bank card resets).


#### 2. Whitelist/Blacklist

Whitelists and blacklists are control methodologies used for accessing website, email, software and IP addresses on networks. 

A whitelist is a control mechanism which denies all access to resources by default, it only allows explicitly permitted resources or users. Access to resources is manually configure. This keeps access very restrictive and ensures only safe and trusted users/resources have access. 
Corporate firewalls should employ whitelisting for highly restrictive environments e.g. accessing financial or personnel records and  where only a select few employees require access. 

A blacklist allows  access to all resources by default. Deny rules are then added manually to block certain resources/users. Blacklist is less safe as you may be allowing access to resources from malicious actors, its also dependent on knowing beforehand what to block which sometimes means having to react after an attack as occurred.
 Corporate firewalls should use blacklisting to block domains known to send spam/phishing emails or to restrict access to websites that negatively impact working such as gaming or social media sites.
