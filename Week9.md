**_1. Explain some of the physical security threats faced by a typical organisation and some measures they could take to protect themselves against these threats._**

#### Physical security threats

Physical security threats faced by a typical organisation include:

- Unauthorized access to critical areas like server rooms, which contain network data and equipment. OR tailgating through secure doors.

- Theft or loss of keys and access cards, which compromises locked areas. 

- Theft of portable devices, such as laptops and external storage drives, when they are not in use. 


To protect against these threats an organisation can employ these physical security methods: 

- Access control: Using card entry systems or biometrics (like fingerprint scanners) to identify and log every person who enters a secure room. 

- Mantraps: Turnstyle type equipment, which only allow one person at a time to pass through. This eliminates tailgating.

- Surveillance: Installing CCTV for visual evidence and employing security staff to monitor cameras, patrol areas, and to check identification. 

- Alarms: Using door, window, or motion-sensor alarms to detect forced entry or unauthorised presence, which can be connected to a security company for 24-hour monitoring. 

- Equipment protection: Securing portable devices in locked cabinets overnight or when not is use. Encrypting portable hard drives, e.g. laptop drives, and enabling remote wipe in case a device is stolen.
