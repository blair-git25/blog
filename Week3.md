## Learning Outcome 2

#### 1. Password Policy

The reason to have a password policy is to ensure all passwords are complex and will protect the user from brute force attempts. Standardising the method passwords are generated ensures all your passwords, or passwords of others, are robust and help to prevent against unauthorised access.

##### My password policy:
* Permitted characters will be all keyboard characters/symbols and numbers.
* Length will be a minimum of 16 characters.
* Can't use any of your personal information (name, birthday)
* Must contain at least 3 of the following:
    * At least one number
    * At least one symbol (@/!$%&* etc.)
    * At least one character (A-Z, a-z)
    * Upper and lower case characters
* Account will be locked after 5 bad attempts
* Account will auto unlock after 60 minutes
* Password will expire every 180 days
* Can't use a previous password

##### Example password:
For this example I've created a complex password, which meets all my criteria above and is also easy to remember. I chose 2 objects in a room (an Elitedesk pc and a window) and combined them into a passphrase, swapped out some letters for numbers, capitalised the beginning letters and added the ! symbol to each end. This makes it complex, but enough of a pattern to be able to remember.

#### 2. Importance of Encryption

It is important to encrypt sensitive data to maintain privacy/confidentiality, protect from data breaches and ensure data integrity. When sending sensitive data via email, its best to use an encrypted service like Protonmail. Protonmail uses end-to-end encryption, meaning that the sensitive data is fully encrypted while the email is in transit. This protects your data in the event that the email is intercepted, the data inside will be encrypted and unreadable.
