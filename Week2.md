## Learning Outcome 1

**_Research and describe a contemporary (i.e. in the last 2 years) example of a reported data breach, and explain the implications to both the company and the client. You should state in your answer what caused the data breach and how this could have been prevented._**

#### Afghan Email Data Breach


##### Data breach

In September 2021 the Ministry of Defence (MoD) sent group emails to Afghan nationals who were seeking to relocate to the UK after the Taliban had taken control. Many of these Afghans had worked for the British Government in Afghanistan assisting as translators and guides. 

The data breach happened when some of these group emails were sent using the 'CC' field instead of 'BCC'. This inadvertently made all the email addresses visible to every recipient. This affected 256 Afghans, with their email addresses and some profile pictures exposed.


##### Implications to the company

Once the MoD were aware of the breach they contacted the people affected asking them to delete the mail, change their email address and inform them of their new contact details via a secure form.

The MoD also implemented a 'second pair of eyes' policy when sending emails to external recipient groups, this involved emails being double checked by another member of staff before sending.

Finally, the MoD were fined by the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) for Â£350,000. They also had to set up compensation and support for the affected individuals, increasing the costs substantially.

##### Implications to the client

The primary and most significant implication was that the breach put lives at risk. Many of the 256 Afghans had worked for the British Government making them a prime target for the Taliban as retribution. Some of the Afghans were still living in Afghanistan.
The breach not only exposed personal email addresses, but some recipients had their profile pictures leaked as well.
The breach also caused severe fear and anxiety for the Afghans as many had already been living in hiding due to their past work with the UK.
